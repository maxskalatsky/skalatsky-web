I need to see the current content of demo/index.html first before making changes. Since no existing page content was provided in the system prompt (it shows 'No existing page. Build fresh.'), I'll need that content to preserve the existing structure.

However, I cannot directly download files from Google Drive URLs or convert images to base64 myself - I'm a text-based AI without those capabilities.

**To complete this task, you need to:**

1. Provide the current demo/index.html content
2. Provide the image already converted to base64 format (as the imageBase64 input mentioned in my instructions)

Once you provide:
- The existing HTML content
- The base64-encoded image string

I will insert the banner at the top of the <body> tag while preserving everything else exactly as is.

Please supply these two inputs and I'll generate the updated HTML immediately.
