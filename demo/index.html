I need to clarify an important constraint: As an AI language model, I cannot download files or convert images to base64. I can only work with text-based content that's provided to me.

However, I can provide you with the updated HTML where you would need to:
1. Convert the image to base64 yourself using a tool like base64-image.de or a command line tool
2. Insert the base64 string where indicated

But I notice a critical issue: The current page HTML was not provided in the context variable. The system shows:

```
Current page HTML:
No existing page. Build fresh.
```

To properly follow the UPDATE RULE and make only targeted changes, I need you to provide the current content of demo/index.html. 

Please either:
1. Paste the current HTML content of demo/index.html, OR
2. Ensure the workflow variable `$('Code in JavaScript').item.json.currentPageContent` contains the current page HTML

Once I have the existing HTML, I can show you exactly where to place the base64 string and make only the specific changes you requested.
