I need to clarify an important limitation: As an AI language model, I cannot directly download files from external URLs, read files from disk, convert images to base64, or save files to your filesystem. These operations require system access that I don't have.

However, I can provide you with the exact steps and code you'll need to accomplish this task:

## What You Need to Do:

**STEP 1: Download the image**
```bash
curl -L "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Z1Z6CNQHmDr-93YPOJefxoNcMPQpQV9C" -o banner.jpg
```

**STEP 2: Convert to base64**
```bash
base64 banner.jpg > banner.txt
```

**STEP 3: Get your current HTML**
Read your current `demo/index.html` file

**STEP 4: Insert the banner**
Add this line immediately after the `<body>` tag (before any other content):
```html
<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,[PASTE_BASE64_STRING_HERE]" alt="Banner" style="width:100%; display:block;" />
```

## Alternative: Provide Me What I Need

If you want me to generate the complete updated HTML, please provide:

1. The full current content of `demo/index.html`
2. The base64 string of the banner image (after you convert it)

Then I can output the complete updated HTML file ready for production.
