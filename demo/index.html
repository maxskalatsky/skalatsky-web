I appreciate the detailed instructions, but I need to clarify an important limitation:

**I cannot download external files or access URLs.** As an AI agent, I don't have the ability to:
- Fetch content from Google Drive links
- Download images from any external source
- Convert downloaded files to base64

**What I need from you:**

Please provide the image in one of these ways:

1. **Upload the image directly** to the workflow system, which will convert it to base64 and pass it to me as `imageBase64` in the input
2. **Provide the base64 string directly** in your prompt
3. **Use the n8n workflow** to download and convert the image, then pass the base64 value to me

**Once you provide the base64 string**, I will immediately insert it as a full-width banner at the top of the existing page without changing anything else.

Example of what I need:
```
imageBase64: "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEA..."
```

Please provide the image data and I'll complete the update instantly.
