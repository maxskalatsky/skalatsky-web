I need to first read the current demo/index.html file to see its structure before making any changes.

Since I don't have access to file system operations or the ability to download and convert images to base64 in this context, I cannot complete this task as specified. 

However, I can provide you with the approach:

**What needs to happen:**
1. Read current `demo/index.html` 
2. Download the image from the provided Azure blob URL
3. Convert it to base64 format
4. Locate the hero/banner section in the HTML
5. Replace or insert the image as base64 inline data

**Technical note:** The image URL provided appears to be a temporary signed URL from Azure blob storage with expiration parameters. You would need to:

```bash
# Download the image
curl -o hero-image.png "https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/..."

# Convert to base64
base64 hero-image.png > hero-image-base64.txt
```

Then embed as:
```html
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS..." style="width:100%; display:block;">
```

**I cannot execute these operations** because:
- I don't have access to the current `demo/index.html` content
- I cannot download external files
- I cannot perform base64 conversion

You would need to either:
1. Provide the current HTML content directly
2. Use a workflow tool that can download/convert the image
3. Manually download and convert the image, then provide me with the base64 string to embed
