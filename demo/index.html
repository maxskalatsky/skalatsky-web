I need to see the current content of demo/index.html first before making changes. Based on your instruction, there's no existing page content provided in the system prompt (it shows 'No existing page. Build fresh.').

However, since you're asking me to "update only" and "read the existing file first," but no current page HTML was provided to me, I cannot fulfill the UPDATE RULE as specified.

To proceed correctly, please provide:
1. The current HTML content of demo/index.html, OR
2. The base64-encoded image data for the banner

Without the existing page content, I cannot preserve the current structure and make only the requested change. The system shows `currentPageContent` as undefined/null.

Please supply the current page HTML so I can add the banner image at the top while preserving everything else exactly as it exists.
