I need to follow the steps you've outlined, but I must clarify my limitations:

**I cannot directly:**
1. Read files from a filesystem or GitHub repository
2. Download images from URLs (including Google Drive)
3. Convert images to base64

**However, I can provide you with the solution approach:**

Since you mentioned this is part of an n8n workflow with a "Code in JavaScript" node that provides `currentPageContent` and `imageBase64`, the workflow should:

1. **Fetch the current HTML** from demo/index.html
2. **Download the image** from the Google Drive URL
3. **Convert it to base64** 
4. **Pass both** to me as input

---

**If you provide me with:**
- The current HTML content of demo/index.html (as `currentPageContent`)
- The base64-encoded image string (as `imageBase64`)

**I will output:** The complete updated HTML with the banner inserted as the first element in `<body>`.

---

**For your n8n workflow**, add this JavaScript code node before calling me:

```javascript
// Fetch current page
const currentPageContent = ... // read from GitHub/filesystem

// Download and convert image
const imageUrl = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Z1Z6CNQHmDr-93YPOJefxoNcMPQpQV9C';
const response = await fetch(imageUrl);
const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
const base64 = Buffer.from(buffer).toString('base64');
const mimeType = response.headers.get('content-type') || 'image/png';
const imageBase64 = `data:${mimeType};base64,${base64}`;

return {
  currentPageContent,
  imageBase64
};
```

Then pass both values to me, and I'll insert the banner correctly.
