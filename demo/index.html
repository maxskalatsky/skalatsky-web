I cannot access external links like Google Drive. To update the demo/index.html with your CSS, please either:

1. **Paste the CSS content directly** in your message
2. **Describe the styling changes** you want applied
3. **Upload the CSS file** if your interface supports it

Once you provide the CSS content or describe the desired changes, I'll update the page immediately with raw HTML output.
